What began as an attempt to learn [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) led to the creation of this personal website. Thank you for visiting.

### Education and Profession

I hold a [Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Analytics](https://www.rockhurst.edu/cbt/school-technology/data-analytics) from the Helzberg School of Management at Rockhurst University, as well as a [Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/imse/) from the University of Missouri.

My professional trajectory has included:
- Industrial Engineer and Quality Supervisor in Kansas City, Missouri.
- Data Scientist in business analytics and applied statistics.
- Software Engineer, currently working in the Denver/Boulder metropolitan area.

This sequence of career titles may look linear. It was not.

### Hobbies

I enjoy building systems at multiple scales: home servers, containerized applications, and the occasional side project involving retro video game preservation.

Other hobbies include:
- Running long distances at a pace best described as “sustainable.”
- Playing video games, in addition to maintaining the hardware and software ecosystems required to play said video games.
- Spending time with my wife and two children.

### Personality Assessment Documents

My previoius employers have attempted to quantify my personality. These efforts resulted in downloadable files:
- 2009 — [CliftonStrengths](https://www.strengthsquest.com/home.aspx) | [PDF](2009_strengthsquest.pdf)
- 2015 — [How to Fascinate](https://www.howtofascinate.com/) | [PDF](2015_fascination_advantage.pdf)
