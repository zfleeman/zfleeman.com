What began as an attempt to learn [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) led to the creation of my personal website. Thank you for visiting.

### Education and Profession

I hold a [Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Analytics](https://www.rockhurst.edu/helzberg/msbia) from the Helzberg School of Management at Rockhurst University along with a [Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/imse/) from the University of Missouri.

Currently, I am a data scientist turned software engineer based in the Denver/Boulder, Colorado metropolitan area. Previously, I worked as an industrial engineer and quality supervisor at a factory in Kansas City, Missouri.

### Hobbies

I love to tinker and create. I enjoy running long distances, playing with my children, and working on programming projects involving video games. Also, actually playing video games is pretty fun too.

### Personality Assessment Documents

My former employers once paid for the staff to take personality tests. Here they are:
- 2009 - [CliftonStrengths](https://www.strengthsquest.com/home.aspx) | [PDF](2009_strengthsquest.pdf)
- 2015 - [How to Fascinate](https://www.howtofascinate.com/) | [PDF](2015_fascination_advantage.pdf)
